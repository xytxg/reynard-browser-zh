# Reynard Browser

Reynard is a **Gecko-based** web browser for iOS 13+.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is the Simplified Chinese maintenance build. It preserves the upstream Gecko architecture
> and publishes verified unsigned IPA source builds on this repository's
> [Releases](https://github.com/xytxg/reynard-browser-zh/releases) page.

Unlike other browsers on iOS that are forced to use Apple's **WebKit** engine (including Safari and all third-party browsers), Reynard uses **Gecko**. This is the same engine that powers the Firefox browser on desktop and Android devices.

This project is mainly for users on older iOS versions who are stuck with an outdated version of WebKit. Because WebKit is bundled with the OS, these devices cannot receive engine updates and often fail to load modern websites. By using Gecko, which is kept up to date independently, Reynard allows these sites to work again. Users on newer iOS versions can also use the browser if they want an alternative to WebKit, including Firefox add-ons and other Gecko-exclusive features.

## Installation

The latest Simplified Chinese source builds are available on this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/xytxg/reynard-browser-zh/releases) page. These IPA files are unsigned and must be signed with a compatible sideloading method before installation. Please note that this project is still in an early experimental state, so expect bugs and missing features.

### TrollStore (iOS 14 - 16.6.1, 17.0)

For the best experience, I'd recommend sideloading Reynard via [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) using the `Reynard-TrollStore.tipa` build. This gives you automatic JIT enablement, better performance, and automatic app updates. For automatic app updates, make sure that the **URL Scheme Enabled** option is turned on in TrollStore.

### AltStore or SideStore (iOS 17.0.1+)

You should use [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) or [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/) to sideload the `Reynard.ipa` build when TrollStore is not available, especially on newer iOS versions. Please note that you must select the **Keep App Extensions** option during installation, as Reynard relies on its extensions to function and will not work without them. 

Download the latest unsigned Chinese build from this repository's Releases page, then let AltStore or SideStore sign it while preserving App Extensions. The legacy upstream AltSource is not used for these Chinese maintenance builds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **LiveContainer is not supported** due to its own limitations.
> - Sideloading methods that use a distribution certificate for signing are **not supported**.⁠
> - Other sideloading methods are **untested**, and **no support will be provided** for issues arising from them.

### Jailbroken (iOS 13)

Sideload the `Reynard-Jailbroken.ipa` build using [Filza File Manager](https://www.tigisoftware.com/default/?page_id=78) with [AppSync Unified](https://github.com/akemin-dayo/AppSync) on a **jailbroken device**. You will also benefit from automatic JIT enablement and better performance.

## Preview

### iOS 14 (iPhone 6S Plus, 14.1)

These sites are known to break or render incorrectly on iOS 14. The screenshots below compare how they load in Safari versus Reynard.

## Notes

This project initially started out of curiosity. I wanted to see if I could get Gecko to run without the [BrowserEngineKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/browserenginekit) framework, so it could be further modified to run on iOS versions as far back as possible. I got it working, and since then, I’ve been focusing on developing engine patches for better UIKit integration, fixing bugs, and turning this into a full, usable browser.

If you’ve come across this repository and find it interesting, I’d love to get help or collaborate on it. I’m learning as I go here and don’t have much prior experience with iOS app development or with Gecko itself, so any contributions, feedback, or pointers would be greatly appreciated.
